                        <p class="introduction">
                            I am a recent Louisiana Tech University graduate eager to start my career in cybersecurity, IT, field technology, customer support, or related fields. With a solid educational foundation and a passion for problem-solving, I am driven to contribute innovative solutions and thrive in dynamic, collaborative environments. My goal is to grow professionally while creating value for the teams and organizations I join.

                        <p class="bio">
                            I am incredibly grateful for my supportive family and aspire to give back to them for all they’ve done for me. I enjoy honing my skills, reading, and, when I have downtime, playing online games to connect with friends and share meaningful conversations.

                            Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. I look forward to sharing future updates to my portfolio and, perhaps, getting to know you as well. Until then, I wish you a wonderful and fulfilling life—may you only regret the chances you took that didn’t work out, not the ones you never tried.
